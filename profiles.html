<h1><u>Who Am I?</u></h1>
	<p> The CEO of Angelz With Wheels car club. I personally did not get into cars until my early 20's when I met my husband. Through the course of our realtionship I learned more about cars, and evenutally falling inlove with racing.</p>

<h2><u>My Car</u></h2>
	<p> I drive a 2014 BMW Alpina B7, pushing close to 700hp. A 1 in 3 for trims and drive train, its 1 of apx 600 cars sitting in the North America continet. It is the definition of a sleeper car. I drive it as a daily driver and track race car. It's also not uncommon for you to find me looking for the occassional street races. Not only</p>

<h3><u>Dreams Behind Club</u></h3>
	<p> Not long after I got my car, I started to go to award shows. I have multiple awards for my car not just show, but track as well. Yet, still when we attend shows I found people always talking to my husband, never to me. Now I have a daughter who is a die hard gear head. Soon she will be racing and showing her own cars. I wanted to create a car club, and enviroment where she has a better start than what other female gearheads have had going into the world of motorsports.</p>
