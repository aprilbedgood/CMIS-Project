<h1><u>Who Am I?</u></h1>
	<p> Hello, I am April who is only a few years into the passion of automobiles. I met my husband several years ago and he had the love for it. I got into as a way to connect to him, instead I feel inlove with much more than the man. </p><p> Racing became second nature. It is very common through spring into fall, to find us at the car shows, or on a drag strip, maybe sometimes both. You might even be able to find me looking for a match on the street.</p>
	
	<h1><u>Dreams Behind Club</u></h1>
	<p> When I started in the world I knew I was comming to play in a man world, even though women have been racing for years. </p><p> Now I have daughter who is made up of grease, speed, and glitter. At a young age she is head over heels in love with racing and cars. I want her to have a place in the world where she won't have to fight for the respect.</p>
	
	<h1><u>My Car</u></h1>
	<p> I drive a 2014 BMW Alpina B7, pushing close to 700hp. A 1 in 3 for trims and drive train, its 1 of apx 600 cars sitting in the North America continet. It is the definition of a sleeper car. </p>
